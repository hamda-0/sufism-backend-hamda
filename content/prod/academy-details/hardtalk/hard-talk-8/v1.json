You see the whirling, the poetry, the incense, the chants and you label it entertainment. Yet you have not entered the fire from which those movements rise. You have not heard the silent scream of the ego being extinguished, or tasted the bitterness of self-discipline that precedes the sweetness of divine presence.</p><p class=\"font-semibold text-center text-xl\">Let me offer you the truth, not as argument, but as unveiling.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Sufism is not a side dish to Islam, nor a diluted form of religion for the romantic-minded. It is the deep interior of the Shari'ah, the breath of the Sunnah, and the echo of the Qur'an in the chambers of the heart.</p><ul><li><strong>The Qur'an says:</strong> \"Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.\" (13:28)</li><li><strong>The Prophet ﷺ said:</strong> \"There is a polish for everything, and the polish for the heart is the remembrance of Allah.\"</li></ul><p>The Sufi does not bypass the Shari'ah, he breathes it until it disappears into his being. He does not perform dhikr to impress, he does it to disappear.</p>"

Sufism, by contrast, begins by crucifying the nafs. The Sufi disciplines the tongue, the limbs, the appetite.</p><p>How can something that burns the ego, confronts the heart, and silences the soul be confused with entertainment?</p>"

And if your eyes were polished, you would see not a dancer, but a flame yearning to rise.</p>"
